### **Sentiment Analysis in Movie Reviews**

### **Project Overview**

This project aims to analyze sentiment in movie reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It involves preprocessing text data, performing feature engineering, and building a sentiment analysis model. The sentiment analysis model is trained to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) expressed in movie reviews.
